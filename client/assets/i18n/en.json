	"faq-area.tab.token.q3":			"How can we get these SSW tokens?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a3":			"The Grey Matter Technologies company send out this ICO (Initial Coin Offering) issuing these SSW tokens. Later, the tokens can be exchanged, particularly on Secure Swap.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q4":			"How is the payment calculated?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a4":			"The nodes are specialized for each supported blockchain. They ensure the connection of the P2P network to the blockchains and are called “gateway node”. For each blockchain, there is a certain amount of gateway nodes, each one with SSW tokens attributed.<br />For example, if a gateway node is sent out on the blockchain EOS, and a wallet with 10 SSW tokens is associated to it, and if all the gateway nodes on the blockchain EOS have together 100 SSW tokens associated, then the owner of the node receives 10% (10/100) of the exchange costs, for all the exchanges done with the EOS cryptocurrency, automatically, on a formerly indicated EOS wallet.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q5":			"How will Grey Matter Technologies guarantee its benefits with this system?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a5":			"As node owners, the company will place P2P nodes associated with the tokens it will own at the end of the ICO (the unsold ones).",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q6":			"And if the company sells all its tokens during the ICO, would it be running out of SSW tokens?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a6":			"The company could get benefits via the cryptocurrencies exchanges to fiat money, which are not shared via the tokens system, but come back entirely to the operators of such exchanges. It could also buy more SSW tokens once the service becomes operational.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q7":			"Does that mean that Grey Matter Technologies keeps for itself the <span class=\"balloon\" data-balloon-pos=\"up\" data-balloon=\"State currency issued by central banks\">fiat</span> money?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a7":			"No, because of its open-source and community aspect, Secure Swap allows anyone to use exchange gateways to fiat money. Yet, a legal structure is necessary, and it must observe the rules of the place where these exchanges are performed. The Grey Matter Technologies company plans to start doing exchanges to fiat money in Chile, Peru and Argentina.",
	"faq-area.tab.client":				"Security",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q1":			"In such a community and open-source system, how do you guarantee the exchanges security?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a1":			"All the gateway nodes to a cryptocurrency responds to the request from the client applications that participate in an exchange. If the nodes respond differently, that means there is a hacking attempt. In this case, a system based on a proof of stakes eliminates the non-compliant nodes by disconnecting and blacklisting them.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q2":			"How does the proof of stakes work?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a2":			"When the nodes give different answers during an exchange validation steps, then the standard answer becomes majority on all the nodes, each node having a vote weigh corresponding to the SSW tokens associated to its function. The nodes that answer differently are disconnected and blacklisted. So, to steal a transaction, it would be necessary to invest a quantity of SSW tokens representing more than half the tokens assigned to the gateway nodes to that cryptocurrency. Which means a value superior to stealing a transaction, a hacking that will not be done since as soon as the problem is detected the transaction will be cancelled. If the hacker invested a sufficient amount to control all the gateway nodes, the exchanger would lose his reputation and the consequence would be a quick drop of the SSW tokens value; the operation would be a loss for the hacker, the number of tokens involved would make it very expensive. Besides, as soon as a problem is detected, the exchanges with that cryptocurrency are interrupted, and the hacker has no transaction to steal.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q3":			"If the nodes are hacked and pass under control of the hacker, how can you guarantee that the security system keeps functioning?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a3":			"Initially, the gateway nodes will be honest, we know it because we ourselves will send the first nodes at the beginning of the service. Since the client application waits for the confirmation of all the gateway nodes to a cryptocurrency to send the coins, if all the gateway nodes do not give the same answer, that means there is a problem. The clients involved in that exchange cancel the transaction and inform all the p2p network that the exchanges on the cryptocurrency are disactivated, which will cancel all the waiting orders from all the clients connected for that cryptocurrency. There is no more exchanges, the hacker has no transaction to steal.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q4":			"How do the exchanges start again a cryptocurrency, after been disactivated because of an anomaly?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a4":			"It needs a unanimous vote of a qualified majority (60%) of the representatives connected for that cryptocurrency, formerly selected, for the exchanges to start again. Those representatives are responsible to make sure that the nodes being active of the cryptocurrency comply before authorizing again the exchanges on that cryptocurrency.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q5":			"How can the representatives make sure that the gateway nodes are honest before voting?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a5":			"By connecting themselves a node gateway or by verifying that their nodes are still connected. With only one reliable node connected, the problem will be detected if the nodes respond differently again. And again, the exchanges on that cryptocurrency would be suspended and cancelled.<br />If the trading restarts without incident, that means the exchanges are reliable and that the malicious nodes were cleaned. If malicious nodes are sleeping and function correctly while waiting to get into action, when they do so, they will be detected because of their different responses. Therefore, any intent of node corruption is detected and stealing a transaction is impossible.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q6":			"How are the representatives designated?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a6":			"They are volunteers and qualify only if they have 100 times the amount of an average exchange, in equivalent value of SSW tokens. The volunteer sends the request through its node interface, and if qualified, all the nodes of the network memorize its status of “super node gateway. The “super node gateway is gratified with a 50% bonus on its remuneration, compared to what it would normally be considering the tokens allocated.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q7":			"How can you prevent dishonest people to permanently connect defective nodes to block the service?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a7":			"The deviant nodes being blacklisted, beside disconnected, these dishonest people will quickly be running out of IP addresses to connect those nodes. Besides, such an IT sabotage action being illegal, its repetition will increase the chance to identify their authors, and Grey Matter Technologies with pursue these people to demand compensation.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q8":			"What measures are taken to fight against the hackers?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a8":			"Beside the protocols described previously, and beside the fact that the whole Secure Swap project is available to everyone in Open source, we will have Bug Bounty campaigns every 3 months with awards for the ones who would find a breach in the system.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal":				"Legal",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q1":			"Are there people excluded from the crowdsale?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a1":			"Currently, America is excluded per SEC rules; Singapore is excluded for tax reasons; Chinese citizens are excluded due to China’s central bank regulation; South Korea citizens are excluded due to regulator’s ban. North Korea and Thailand are also excluded.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q2":			"Is there a KYC process involved?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a2":			"No, its distributed and community aspect makes the service independent of the existence of the company that created it and does not need it to function. In this context, there is no need to identify individuals.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q3":			"Why is there some negativity regarding ICOs lately?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a3":			"Many ICOs were launched merely as a \"cash grab\", with no real intention to deliver a viable product or service. In some cases, the ICO was built as a scam from the onset. In other cases, the founders had good intentions but their plan was flawed and investors bought in only due to \"speculation\" frenzy. <br />Secure Swap falls into a different category of being a viable product idea, with a competent team, and is a project of massive scope and potential --provided that the community supports the SSW ICO to the extent of being able to develop and launch the final product. Our hope is that by providing a wealth of transparency (Open source project), interested parties will see our \"vision\" and agree that we have a solid plan to reach our goals and deal with any obstacles that get in the way.<br />We applaud the SEC for <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings\" target=\"_blank\" >taking steps to protect consumers and investors</a> from unscrupulous types who have misused ICOs for quick financial gain. Their efforts will, hopefully, have a marked effect on the number of ICOs launched after their announcement. Those ICOs that do launch, such as the SSW ICO, will not have to compete with as many \"scam ICOs\", as a direct result of the SEC guidance. So, that is a WIN for everyone!",
