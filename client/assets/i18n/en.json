Refers to computer systems that communicate to each other through a network without passing through a central server. Each computer on the network communicates with each other computer.\">P2P</span> nodes?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a1":			"Those who operate gateway nodes, and therefore support the operation of the service, will receive, in proportion to the SSW tokens they have allocated to this node, their share of the exchange fees paid by the traders. They will therefore be automatically remunerated for this.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q2":			"How SSW tokens are attributed to a node?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a2":			"In the configuration of the node, the wallet containing the SSW tokens that are allocated to this node is indicated. This same wallet can only be allocated to one node at a time. The tokens allocated to the node are transferred to a wallet managed by a smart contract, and will be returned when the node stops. They serve as a guarantee for exchanges.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q3":			"How can we get these SSW tokens?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a3":			"The <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> company launches this ICO (Initial Coin Offering) by issuing these SSW tokens. Thereafter, these tokens may be exchanged, in particular on Secure Swap.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q4":			"How is the remuneration calculated?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a4":			"Nodes are specialized for each supported blockchain. They connect the p2p network to the blockchains, and are called gateway nodes. For each blockchain there are a number of gateway nodes, each with SSW tokens allocated.<br />For example, if a gateway node is launched on the EOS blockchain, and a wallet containing 10 SSW tokens is allocated to it, and all the gateway nodes on the EOS blockchain together have 100 SSW tokens allocated, then the node owner receives a 10% (10/100) exchange fee, for all exchanges made with EOS crypto-currency automatically on the previously specified EOS wallet.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q5":			"How will <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> guarantee its benefits with this system?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a5":			"Like NodeOwners, the company will operate p2p nodes by allocating to them the tokens it have.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q6":			"So <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> reserves the exchange to <span class=\"balloon\" data-balloon-pos=\"up\" data-balloon=\"State currency issued by central banks\">fiat</span> currencies for itself?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a6":			"No, due to its open-source and community nature, Secure Swap allows anyone to use exchange gateways to fiat currencies. However, this requires a legal structure and compliance with the regulations of the country where the trade is carried out. <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> plans to start trading in fiat currencies in Chile, Peru and Argentina.",
	"faq-area.tab.client":				"Security",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q1":			"In such a community and open-source system, how can we ensure the security of exchanges?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a1":			"All gateway nodes to a crypto-currency respond to a request from client applications participating in an exchange. If the nodes respond differently, it is because there is a hacking attempt or a malfunction. In this case, a system based on a proof of stake, eliminates non-compliant nodes by disconnecting them.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q2":			"How does this system of proof of stake work?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a2":			"When nodes give different responses during the validation steps of an exchange, then the reference response is the one that is the majority on all nodes, each node having a voting weight corresponding to the SSW tokens allocated to its operation. Nodes responding differently are disconnected. Thus, to attempt to steal a transaction, it would be necessary to invest a quantity of SSW tokens representing more than half of the tokens allocated to the gateway nodes to this crypto-currency. This represents a higher value than the theft of a transaction. In any case, this robbery has no chance of success since, as soon as an anomaly is detected, the transaction is cancelled.<br />In addition, if the operator of such a node kept the counterparties of the transactions, their values would be debited from the SSW tokens pledged as guarantee on this node for an equivalent amount, converted into the crypto-currency expected by the trader and sent to him. If the hacker put significant resources into it to take control of all the gateway nodes, this operation would ultimately be a loss for the hacker, probably very expensive, given the number of tokens he would have to commit to achieve this and which would be lost for him. The operation would consist for the hacker in buying all the crypto-currencies he diverts at market price, and in assuming all the costs generated by these operations. Traders are continuing to receive the counterparties for their trades as planned.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q3":			"If nodes are hacked and come under malicious control, how can we ensure that this security system remains operational?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a3":			"Initially, the gateway nodes will be honest, we know this because we will launch the first nodes ourselves when the service starts. Since Secure Trade is waiting for confirmation of all gateway nodes to a crypto-currency to send assets, if not all gateway nodes provide the same answer, there is a problem. The applications involved in this exchange then cancel the transaction, and inform the entire p2p network. In the end, the hacker pays for the diversion of counterparties, which are therefore always delivered to traders.  And his node is disconnected from the network.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q8":			"What other measures are being taken to fight piracy?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a8":			"In addition to the protocols described in the previous answers, and in addition to the fact that the entire Secure Swap project is available to everyone under Open Source license, we launch Bug Bounty campaigns every 3 months with a reward for those who find a vulnerability in the system.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal":				"Legal",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q1":			"Are there people excluded from the crowdsale?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a1":			"Currently, Singapore is excluded for tax reasons; Chinese citizens are excluded due to China’s central bank regulation; South Korea citizens are excluded due to regulator’s ban. North Korea and Thailand are also excluded.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q2":			"Is there a KYC process involved?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a2":			"Not at the moment. To exploit its conversion nodes to fiat currencies and payment systems, each legal entity created for this purpose, independent of Grey Matter Technologies SpA, will comply with the KYC/AML/CFT/FCA regulations.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q3":			"Why is there some negativity regarding ICOs lately?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a3":			"Many ICOs were launched merely as a \"cash grab\", with no real intention to deliver a viable product or service. In some cases, the ICO was built as a scam from the onset. In other cases, the founders had good intentions but their plan was flawed and investors bought in only due to \"speculation\" frenzy. <br />Secure Swap falls into a different category of being a viable product idea, with a competent team, and is a project of massive scope and potential --provided that the community supports the SSW ICO to the extent of being able to develop and launch the final product. Our hope is that by providing a wealth of transparency (Open source project), interested parties will see our \"vision\" and agree that we have a solid plan to reach our goals and deal with any obstacles that get in the way.<br />We applaud the SEC for <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings\" target=\"_blank\" >taking steps to protect consumers and investors</a> from unscrupulous types who have misused ICOs for quick financial gain. Their efforts will, hopefully, have a marked effect on the number of ICOs launched after their announcement. Those ICOs that do launch, such as the SSW ICO, will not have to compete with as many \"scam ICOs\", as a direct result of the SEC guidance. So, that is a WIN for everyone!",
