	"token-area.p8":					"In the $1 ecosystem, margin-trading is being made possible, despite the total anonymity of the participants, by the use of $2 tokens as a guarantee.

If this is not the case, or if a node simply disconnects from the network, then the $2 tokens deposited as guarantee (and managed by a smart contract), will be used to refund the traders (who would otherwise have been harmed). This process is transparent to traders, the $1 network makes the necessary conversions so that traders receive the crypto-currencies they expect. At the end of these refund operations, the remaining balance of $2 tokens deposited as a guarantee is returned to the wallet of the operator of the offending node.

	"faq-area.tab.general":				"General",
	"faq-area.tab.general.q1":			"What is Secure Swap?",
	"faq-area.tab.general.a1":			"Secure Swap is a community-based decentralized crypto-currency exchanger (DEX). It is developed by <i>Grey Mater Technologies SpA</i>, based in Chile, by a French founding team.",
	"faq-area.tab.general.q2":			"Which crypto-currencies does it support?",
	"faq-area.tab.general.a2":			"Potentially all digital currencies can be exchanged. When launched, the service will support the most popular crypto-currencies, the others will be added as they are released.",
	"faq-area.tab.general.q3":			"Does Secure Swap support conversions with <span class=\"balloon\" data-balloon-pos=\"up\" data-balloon=\"State currency issued by central banks\">fiat</span> currencies?",
	"faq-area.tab.general.a3":			"Yes, this is planned. At its launch, South American currencies will be supported, as well as USD and EUR. The community nature of our platform will allow other companies to establish themselves in order to offer links to the fiat currencies of their country or region.",
	"faq-area.tab.general.q4":			"What is the community nature of Secure Swap?",
	"faq-area.tab.general.a4":			"The project is under open source license. Its architecture is based on a network of <span class=\"balloon\" data-balloon-pos=\"up\" data-balloon-length=\"large\" data-balloon=\"Acronym for Peer to Peer. Refers to computer systems that communicate to each other through a network without passing through a central server. Each computer on the network communicates with each other computer.\">P2P</span> nodes. Those who find it interesting can operate these nodes.",
	"faq-area.tab.general.q5":			"How does Secure Swap intend to attract traders?",
	"faq-area.tab.general.a5":			"Secure Swap offers a client application, Secure Trade, dedicated to trading based on the network of gateway nodes. This application benefits from our experience in developing professional stock market software. Its ergonomics will be much better than current platforms, and offers a set of innovative tools and trading aids in the world of crypto-currencies.",
	"faq-area.tab.ico":					"ICO",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.q1":				"Can I invest from my country?",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.a1":				"$1 does not exclude persons from any nations from participating in the ICO. All participants are encouraged to check up on any local ICO rules.",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.q2":				"What is the minimum investment?",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.a2":				"L'investissement minimum est de 0,1 ETH",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.q3":				"How can I participate in the ICO Token sale?",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.a3":				"You can participate on $1 ICO simply without time-consuming registration (as we not need any ID data from our investors) and you should choose ammount of investments on ETH. You will receive back $1 tokens on your Ethereum Wallet Address.",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.q4":				"What will the price be on exchanges after the ICO?",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.a4":				"Secondary markets are not controlled by $1. We expect the trading price to rise steadily, investors profits will be affected by trading price fluctuations and price changings.",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.q5":				"How much was raised in private sale and what was the bonus?",
	"faq-area.tab.ico.a5":				"We decided not to do a private sale. Everyone gets the same terms.",

	"faq-area.tab.token.q1":			"What is the interest for a community to operate these <span class=\"balloon\" data-balloon-pos=\"up\" data-balloon-length=\"large\" data-balloon=\"Acronym for Peer to Peer. Refers to computer systems that communicate to each other through a network without passing through a central server. Each computer on the network communicates with each other computer.\">P2P</span> nodes?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a1":			"Those who operate gateway nodes, and therefore support the operation of the service, will receive, in proportion to the SSW tokens they have allocated to this node, their share of the exchange fees paid by the traders. They will therefore be automatically remunerated for this.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q2":			"How SSW tokens are attributed to a node?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a2":			"In the configuration of the node, the wallet containing the SSW tokens that are allocated to this node is indicated. This same wallet can only be allocated to one node at a time. The tokens allocated to the node are transferred to a wallet managed by a smart contract, and will be returned when the node stops. They serve as a guarantee for exchanges.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q3":			"How can we get these SSW tokens?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a3":			"The <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> company launches this ICO (Initial Coin Offering) by issuing these SSW tokens. Thereafter, these tokens may be exchanged, in particular on Secure Swap.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q4":			"How is the remuneration calculated?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a4":			"Nodes are specialized for each supported blockchain. They connect the p2p network to the blockchains, and are called gateway nodes. For each blockchain there are a number of gateway nodes, each with SSW tokens allocated.<br />For example, if a gateway node is launched on the EOS blockchain, and a wallet containing 10 SSW tokens is allocated to it, and all the gateway nodes on the EOS blockchain together have 100 SSW tokens allocated, then the node owner receives a 10% (10/100) exchange fee, for all exchanges made with EOS crypto-currency automatically on the previously specified EOS wallet.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q5":			"How will <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> guarantee its benefits with this system?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a5":			"Like NodeOwners, the company will operate p2p nodes by allocating to them the tokens it will have after the ICO (those that will not be sold).",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q6":			"And if the company sells all its tokens during the ICO, would it end up without SSW tokens?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a6":			"The company will be able to generate profits via the exchange of crypto-currencies into fiat currencies. The profits generated by exchanges are not shared via the token system, but are entirely returned to the operators of such exchanges. The company may also be able to buy back SSW tokens once the service is operational.",
	"faq-area.tab.token.q7":			"So <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> reserves the exchange to <span class=\"balloon\" data-balloon-pos=\"up\" data-balloon=\"State currency issued by central banks\">fiat</span> currencies for itself?",
	"faq-area.tab.token.a7":			"No, due to its open-source and community nature, Secure Swap allows anyone to use exchange gateways to fiat currencies. However, this requires a legal structure and compliance with the regulations of the country where the trade is carried out. <i>Grey Matter Technologies SpA</i> plans to start trading in fiat currencies in Chile, Peru and Argentina.",
	"faq-area.tab.client":				"Security",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q1":			"In such a community and open-source system, how can we ensure the security of exchanges?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a1":			"All gateway nodes to a crypto-currency respond to a request from client applications participating in an exchange. If the nodes respond differently, it is because there is a hacking attempt or a malfunction. In this case, a system based on a proof of stake, eliminates non-compliant nodes by disconnecting them.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q2":			"How does this system of proof of stake work?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a2":			"When nodes give different responses during the validation steps of an exchange, then the reference response is the one that is the majority on all nodes, each node having a voting weight corresponding to the SSW tokens allocated to its operation. Nodes responding differently are disconnected. Thus, to attempt to steal a transaction, it would be necessary to invest a quantity of SSW tokens representing more than half of the tokens allocated to the gateway nodes to this crypto-currency. This represents a higher value than the theft of a transaction. In any case, this robbery has no chance of success since, as soon as an anomaly is detected, the transaction is cancelled.<br />In addition, if the operator of such a node kept the counterparties of the transactions, their values would be debited from the SSW tokens pledged as guarantee on this node for an equivalent amount, converted into the crypto-currency expected by the trader and sent to him. If the hacker put significant resources into it to take control of all the gateway nodes, this operation would ultimately be a loss for the hacker, probably very expensive, given the number of tokens he would have to commit to achieve this and which would be lost for him. The operation would consist for the hacker in buying all the crypto-currencies he diverts at market price, and in assuming all the costs generated by these operations. Traders are continuing to receive the counterparties for their trades as planned.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q3":			"If nodes are hacked and come under malicious control, how can we ensure that this security system remains operational?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a3":			"Initially, the gateway nodes will be honest, we know this because we will launch the first nodes ourselves when the service starts. Since Secure Trade is waiting for confirmation of all gateway nodes to a crypto-currency to send assets, if not all gateway nodes provide the same answer, there is a problem. The applications involved in this exchange then cancel the transaction, and inform the entire p2p network. In the end, the hacker pays for the diversion of counterparties, which are therefore always delivered to traders.  And his node is disconnected from the network.",
	"faq-area.tab.client.q8":			"What other measures are being taken to fight piracy?",
	"faq-area.tab.client.a8":			"In addition to the protocols described in the previous answers, and in addition to the fact that the entire Secure Swap project is available to everyone under Open Source license, we launch Bug Bounty campaigns every 3 months with a reward for those who find a vulnerability in the system.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal":				"Legal",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q1":			"Are there people excluded from the crowdsale?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a1":			"Currently, America is excluded per SEC rules; Singapore is excluded for tax reasons; Chinese citizens are excluded due to China’s central bank regulation; South Korea citizens are excluded due to regulator’s ban. North Korea and Thailand are also excluded.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q2":			"Is there a KYC process involved?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a2":			"No, its distributed and community aspect makes the service independent of the existence of the company that created it and does not need it to function. In this context, there is no need to identify individuals.",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.q3":			"Why is there some negativity regarding ICOs lately?",
	"faq-area.tab.legal.a3":			"Many ICOs were launched merely as a \"cash grab\", with no real intention to deliver a viable product or service. In some cases, the ICO was built as a scam from the onset. In other cases, the founders had good intentions but their plan was flawed and investors bought in only due to \"speculation\" frenzy. <br />Secure Swap falls into a different category of being a viable product idea, with a competent team, and is a project of massive scope and potential --provided that the community supports the SSW ICO to the extent of being able to develop and launch the final product. Our hope is that by providing a wealth of transparency (Open source project), interested parties will see our \"vision\" and agree that we have a solid plan to reach our goals and deal with any obstacles that get in the way.<br />We applaud the SEC for <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings\" target=\"_blank\" >taking steps to protect consumers and investors</a> from unscrupulous types who have misused ICOs for quick financial gain. Their efforts will, hopefully, have a marked effect on the number of ICOs launched after their announcement. Those ICOs that do launch, such as the SSW ICO, will not have to compete with as many \"scam ICOs\", as a direct result of the SEC guidance. So, that is a WIN for everyone!",
