# ![](https://staging.secure-swap.com/assets/images/logo.png) Secure-Swap - ICO Website todo-list

There are a shortened tasks-list that must be done, following the reference document from Richard:<br />
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-make-your-ico-website-attractive-investors-richard-shibi/<br />
(Extracts from the site are noted in <span style="color:SteelBlue">_italic blue_</span>)


1. **<span style="color:SteelBlue">_The website should better have neutral colors, which are not too shining or too bright._</span>**<br /> 
Well, we have the "call to actions" buttons on the site that are quite contrasting. 
I wanted them to reflect the design of the SecureSwap logo. The rest is not especially shiny.... <br>
This point is quite subjective, maybe do a survey with the team...<br />
![](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/fugue/icon_shadowless/arrow-turn-000-left.png) The team confirms. So I reduced the contrast of these buttons.<br />

2. **<span style="color:SteelBlue">_Avoid using hidden menu items, better stick to a standard visible text-based menu items at the top._</span>**<br /> 
![](https://susangarrettdogagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/green-checkmark.png) Done

3. **<span style="color:SteelBlue">_present the most valuable information about the ICO at the very top of the homepage. The best option is to start with an explanatory video._</span>**<br /> 
We will see this for the ICO. <br />
For the pre-ICO, since we don't have a video, I keep the animated SVG graph on the first page, it's the best we have.
For the video on the 2nd page, I replace it with two sections:
   - a comparative table of SS against CEX and DEX 
   - A list of the main features with icons, and text explanation on hover.

   ![](https://susangarrettdogagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/green-checkmark.png) Done

4. **<span style="color:SteelBlue">_Right after the video, you should have the second most important elements laid in a single row, one next to the other:  Whitepaper, OnePager, Investor Deck, Business Model._</span>**<br /> 
Well, we can't put everything right after the video.... :)
So I put the sections concerned right away, and on the first page we have links to these sections.
   - Whitepaper: Moved. And added a link on the home page to the "whitepaper" page
   - OnePager: Done
   - Investor Deck: Moved. And added a link on the home page to the "Sales" page
   - Business Model: <span style="color:SteelBlue">  _The business model is usually available both for private and public sale. In this document, you need to describe how this project creates value. Provide few use cases, address the tokenomics, functionality and why and how people will be able to use your solution._ </span> <br />
   Well, it troubles me... I don't think it's great to go straight into the business model, without even having already shown the Problems & Solutions, the strengths, all that... <br />
   So for now I've ordered it that way:
      - Problemes & solutions : Done
	  - Key Strengths : Done
	  - Market Analisys : Done
	<br/>Then :	
	  - Secure Swap use cases :  Done
	  - Tokenomics & Token functionality : <span style="color:SteelBlue">  _How you design your token role_ </span>:<br />
	  TokenSSW section moved here... with proof of stake, performance, simulator... : Done<br />
	  Just the use of token in margin trading <span style="color:OrangeRed ">remains to be done</span>
	  - <span style="color:SteelBlue">  _why and how people will be able to use your solution_ </span>:<br />
	  Moved in Use-Cases section... Done<br />

   ![](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/fugue/icon_shadowless/cross-script.png) Not done

5. **Purchase section**<br /> 
<span style="color:SteelBlue">  _After having the potential investors watched the explanatory video and gone through part of the documents, they might have already decided to purchase some tokens. Therefore, you must provide them with a link or an option to purchase tokens; here you should present how much has been raised so far, what is the soft cap and what is the hard cap._ </span><br />
Well, this is the Sales page....   Which has been moved up in the investor deck....<br />
So I don't know what to do now....<br />
   ![](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/fugue/icon_shadowless/cross-script.png) Not done

6. **Details**<br /> 
<span style="color:SteelBlue">_Investors may need to get more information before making an investment, so they will keep scrolling down. Impress them with the website, both the visuals and the content, as this will highly reflect on the image of the overall project. 
Once investors have got a general idea of what all this project about, they would like to see more details, so there you need to present the following:_ </span>
   - <span style="color:SteelBlue">_WHAT is the problem you are going to solve_ </span>
   - <span style="color:SteelBlue">_HOW you are going to solve the problem_ </span>
   - <span style="color:SteelBlue">_WHY we need this problem to get solved at all_ </span> <br />

   So then, the document requires:
	- Problems & Solutions : Done
	- Market Research : Done<br />
   Except I prefer to put them above :)<br />
   ![](https://susangarrettdogagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/green-checkmark.png) Done
   
7. **end sections**<br /> 
<span style="color:SteelBlue">_Right after the problem, solution and market research, you should address the last few sections:_ </span><br />
   - Tokenomics: token distribution : Done
   - The Team: Done
   - Roadmap: Done
   - Media Coverage: We don't have any yet, but the section is ready, in case
   - Footer: <span style="color:OrangeRed ">to finish. Requires all SNS ready.</span> <br />
